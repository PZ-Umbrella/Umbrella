All of the library files in this repository are automatically generated by a set of tools. Because of this, **you shouldn't PR this repository directly: your changes will be lost the next time the files are generated**.

## Contributing documentation
Documentation is stored in Rosetta files that are used during library generation so that we can automatically update to reflect any code changes without needing to rewrite documentation. You can PR these files with documentation so that they can be included in future library builds.

The documentation for native Lua objects is stored in the [pz-lua-stubdata](https://github.com/PZ-Umbrella/pz-lua-stubdata) repository.
The documentation for Java classes is stored in the [pz-rosetta-source](https://github.com/PZ-Umbrella/pz-rosetta-source) repository.

## Reporting issues
Issues from documentation inaccuracy should be reported in the appropriate repository mentioned in the *Contributing documentation* section.

Issues with the output other than documentation should be reported in the repository for the appropriate tool. The native Lua library files are generated by [pz-lua-stubgen](https://github.com/PZ-Umbrella/pz-lua-stubgen). The Java library files are generated by [torch](https://github.com/demiurgeQuantified/torch) application [torch-zomboid](https://github.com/PZ-Umbrella/torch-zomboid).
