---(Not exposed)
---A nominal descriptor for a
--- Class constant.
---
--- For common system types, including all the primitive types, there are
--- predefined ClassDesc constants in ConstantDescs.
--- (The java.lang.constant APIs consider void to be a primitive type.)
--- To create a ClassDesc for a class or interface type, use of(java.lang.String) or
--- ofDescriptor(String); to create a ClassDesc for an array
--- type, use ofDescriptor(String), or first obtain a
--- ClassDesc for the component type and then call the arrayType()
--- or arrayType(int) methods.
